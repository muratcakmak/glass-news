# Deployment Rules

Always follow this two-step process when deploying changes:

1.  **Deployment**: Run the deployment command to push changes to the hosting provider.
    ```bash
    bun run deploy:pages
    ```
2.  **Git Push**: Immediately after a successful deployment, add all changes, commit them with a descriptive message, and push to the remote repository.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "chore: [description of changes]"
    git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
    ```

**IMPORTANT**: Never skip the second step (Git Push). The remote repository must always match the deployed version.
